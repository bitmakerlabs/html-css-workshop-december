Step 1 - HTML basic structure

  - HTML5 DOCTYPE declaration
  - Where title appears
  - Where body appears

Step 2 - Adding Basic Block Level Elements

  - Block level elements take up as much space as is given, and by default, will have line breaks before and after
  - Add different levels of headings
  - Add paragraphs

Step 3 - Adding inline elements

  - Inline elements do not break lines before or after

Step 4 - Adding an image

  - Images are inline elements and do not require closing tag
  - Images will take up as much space as their dimensions dictate
  - What happens if we start to play with browser size?

Step 5 - Add logical divisions to content using div and span

  - div and span are widely used to divide areas up in logical groups so they can be manipulated easier
  - div is block level
  - span is inline
  - group things like content vs image, meta-data for article, add footer

Step 6 - Add semantics where possible

  - Semantic elements are for reinforcing the purpose or intention of the content
  - They don't imply any particular display characteristic by default
